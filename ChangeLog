Revision history for Perl extension RPC::XML.

0.25	Tue Jun 12 22:35:09 PDT 2001

	This is the initial release.

0.26	Mon Jun 25 22:30:18 PDT 2001

	Fixed some doc errors in RPC::XML::Server. Mainly things I had
	simplified, but not updated the docs to reflect.

	Added a fair amount to the docs in Apache::RPC::Server. In particular,
	a new section was added that illustrates using <Perl> configuration
	sections to create the server objects in the master Apache process,
	so that they are automatically inherited by children.
