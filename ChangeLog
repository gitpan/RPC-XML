Revision history for Perl extension RPC::XML.

0.29	Sun Dec  2 22:41:39 PST 2001

	Added share_methods(), copy_methods() and delete_method() calls to the
	RPC::XML::Server class (and thus to the Apache class as well). Had
	already added an INSTALL_DIR method to retrieve the class-specific
	installation dir to the Apache class, so mirrored it here, as well.

	Added list_servers() static method to Apache::RPC::Server, to allow
	for abstract retrieval of the ID-tags of the current known servers.
	This is mainly so Apache::RPC::Status can use it in conjunction with
	get_server() to examine the server objects for the sake of stats and
	such.

	Added list_methods() to RPC::XML::Server, to list the object's known
	(published) methods by name. Mainly for use in the regression suites,
	but worth documenting in the API in case someone else finds it
	useful.

	Four of the provided methods in the introspection API
	(system.introspection, system.listMethods, system.methodHelp and
	system.methodSignature) needed to be updated to use the newer API for
	the XML::RPC::Method class when retrieving information from the server.

	Started the test suites for RPC::XML::Method and RPC::XML::Server.
	The tests that are delivered as part of this build are not fully
	complete, but should be a reasonable start.

0.28	Sun Oct  7 21:27:39 PDT 2001

	Found a subtle-but-nasty bug in the handling of RPC::XML::string
	objects. Thanks to Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com> for pointing
	me in the right direction.

	Started down the path of making the suite as a whole geared more
	towards real use than illustrative example. The XML data-classes now
	no longer use indention (or any superfluous whitespace) in their
	stringification. This shortened the code quite a bit, and will also
	mean shorter messages. This could not have been done cleanly without
	the tests in t/10_data.t.

	Extracted the method-manipulation code into a new class, called
	RPC::XML::Method. This should make method-sharing easier, and pull
	a lot of method-specific code out of RPC::XML::Server and
	Apache::RPC::Server.

	Clarified some issues in the new() constructor of the
	Apache::RPC::Server class, and also changed the calling convention.
	It no longer treats the first few arguments in any special way at all.
	The arguments are all consistently taken as option/value pairs, just
	as with RPC::XML::Server. The documentation reflects this. This may
	break things built on the old style, but in the long run it should
	prove much better.

0.27	Sun Jul  8 16:25:51 PDT 2001

	Removed a -w warning from RPC/XML.pm. Fixed some cases in the new()
	method of RPC::XML::boolean that would have permitted invalid data.
	Added two convenience methods to RPC::XML::fault, called code() and
	string(), that fetch the faultCode and faultString member values as
	native Perl values. The RPC::XML::base64 class was using the wrong
	container tags in the as_string method.

	Clarified and expanded some of the documentation in RPC/XML/Server.pm.

	Adjusted the PREREQ_PM hash in Makefile.PL so that it correctly looks
	for LWP, and also looks for File::Spec 0.8 or newer (needed to ensure
	that the splitpath() method is available).

	Cleaned up the load-tests (t/00_load.t) to use the Test harnessing
	package. Added test suites for the RPC::XML data classes (t/10_data.t,
	96 tests) and the RPC::XML::Parser container-class (t/20_parser.t,
	7 tests).

0.26	Mon Jun 25 22:30:18 PDT 2001

	Fixed some doc errors in RPC::XML::Server. Mainly things I had
	simplified, but not updated the docs to reflect.

	Added a fair amount to the docs in Apache::RPC::Server. In particular,
	a new section was added that illustrates using <Perl> configuration
	sections to create the server objects in the master Apache process,
	so that they are automatically inherited by children.

0.25	Tue Jun 12 22:35:09 PDT 2001

	This is the initial release.
