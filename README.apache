Note:

There is currently a known problem with using Apache and mod_perl with version
2.30 of XML::Parser. I have verified this on a Red Hat 6.2 platform using RPM
installs of those two packages. If you encounter problems with child processes
immediately exiting when trying to handle RPC requests, check your version of
XML::Parser. Downgrading to 2.29 should work.

Addendum: XML::Parser 2.31 seems to work with no problems, under a stock
install of Apache and mod_perl on Red Hat systems.
