RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.76

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

* etc/make_method
* lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm
RT #70258: Fixed typos in docs pointed out by Debian team.

* lib/Apache/RPC/Server.pm
Better version of the fix for infinite loops. This is the patch
originally suggested by the Eric Cholet, who found the bug.

* t/00_load.t
RT #70280: This test was still testing RPC/XML/Method.pm.
Rewrote to remove that but include the (forgotten) XMLLibXML.pm
module. That test has to be conditional on the presence of
XML::LibXML.

* Makefile.PL
* t/51_client_with_host_header.t
Clean up test suite to work with older Test::More. Also specify
a minimum Test::More that supports subtest(). This is also a
part of RT #70280.

* t/11_base64_fh.t
* t/20_xml_parser.t
* t/21_xml_libxml.t
* t/40_server.t
These tests had failures when run as root. Permissions-based
negative tests were incorrectly passing.

* t/10_data.t
Moved the 64-bit "TODO" tests to a SKIP block. Non-64-bit
systems will skip, rather than fail, these tests.

* lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm
RT #65616: Fix for slow methods killing servers. Applied and
modified patch from person who opened the ticket.

* MANIFEST
* lib/RPC/XML.pm
* t/10_data.t
* t/14_datetime_iso8601.t (added)
RT #55628: Improve flexibility of date parsing. This adds the
ability to pass any ISO 8601 string to the
RPC::XML::datetime_iso8601 constructor.
