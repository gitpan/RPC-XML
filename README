RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.51

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Removed an extraneous print line in t/11_base64_fh that caused a
warning on some systems.

Fixed calls to skip() in the test suites so that they work with
older versions of the Test module.

Calls to the encode_base64 routine from MIME::Base64 now pass a zero-
length second argument, to suppress newlines between Base64 lines
when stringifying the RPC::XML::base64 objects. This is to accomodate
a broken Java XML-RPC package.

Force a default value for the compress_re attribute in RPC::XML::Server
when none is otherwise present. All my tests have had Compress::Zlib
available, but when it isn't the compress_re attribute was triggering
warnings when used in a regex.
