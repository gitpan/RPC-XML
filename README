RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.44

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Cleaned up the exports list in RPC::XML.pm, which still had remnants
from when this package was intended to extend XML-RPC. There were no
routines to match the symbols, but the potential for error was there.

Fixed a typo in the docs for RPC::XML::Client, and some documentation
goofs in RPC::XML::Server (regarding the timeout method/option). A
few doc fixes in RPC::XML::Procedure, for good measure.

Implemented two fixes sent in by Marc Liyanage: a fix for setting the
Content-Length headers on messages that takes the length in bytes
rather than characters; the second is a fix around the compression
support that makes certain an undef isn't evaluated against the
regex.

The above added an exported function to RPC::XML, so that got
documented. In the process, it occurred to me to document the helper
functions like RPC_BOOLEAN, RPC_DOUBLE, etc.
