RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.75

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

* MANIFEST
Somehow, t/13_no_deep_recursion.t never got added to MANIFEST.

* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLLibXML.pm
RT #65154: Fixed a cut/paste error in an error message.

* lib/RPC/XML/Client.pm
* t/51_client_with_host_header.t (added)
RT #68792: Merge pull request #2 from dragon3/master
(https://github.com/dragon3). Allow setting of "Host" header,
and test suite for it.

* MANIFEST
* t/51_client_with_host_header.t
Added new test suite to MANIFEST, fixed spelling. Also added
"plan tests" line to the test suite.

* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLLibXML.pm
* t/20_xml_parser.t
* t/21_xml_libxml.t
* t/41_server_hang.t
Merge pull request #3 from yannk/master
(https://github.com/yannk). Expat parser subclass is protected
against ext ent attack, libxml isn't.

* t/41_server_hang.t
Undo a change to this suite from yannk's pull.

* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLParser.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/ParserFactory.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Procedure.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm
More perlcritic-driven clean-up. This is mostly POD sections,
but also includes heavy re-working of etc/make_method and parts
of lib/RPC/XML.pm.

* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLLibXML.pm
* t/21_xml_libxml.t
Fixed external entity handling on MacOS. Also made small change
to the test suite to be cleaner.

* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLLibXML.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLParser.pm
Took out warnings on external entities blocking. Now it blocks
silently. Also cleaned up some docs.

* t/15_serialize.t
Additions to increase code coverage in XML.pm.

* lib/RPC/XML.pm
Turns out this wasn't exporting RPC_I8.

* xt/02_pod_coverage.t
Made 5.8.8 the new minimum-required perl. Also dropped the
utf8_downgrade hack, which affected an xt test.

* lib/RPC/XML/Client.pm
Improved arguments-checking in send_request.

* lib/RPC/XML/Client.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLLibXML.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Parser/XMLParser.pm
* lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm
Fixed error-cases in usage of File::Temp->new().
File::Temp::new croaks on errors, doesn't return undef like I
thought.

* MANIFEST
* lib/RPC/XML/Function.pm (deleted)
* lib/RPC/XML/Method.pm (deleted)
* lib/RPC/XML/Procedure.pm
Roll Method.pm and Function.pm into Procedure.pm. Remove
