RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.52

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Really got the warning in RPC::XML::Server.pm this time. Really. Also
got some potential errors that seem to be overlooked under auto-loading
but appear when auto-loading is disabled.

Fixed a potentially-confusing problem in the example code within the
RPC::XML::Client man page, just under "SYNOPSIS".

More work to the spec.in RPM specfile template. The Provides/Requires
list should be a lot cleaner now, and it also builds packages under
rpm 4.1, now.

Fixed a lurking bug in the Apache::RPC::Server class that was not
setting the headers properly on responses. Probably lived this long
because no one else but me was using it, and my client is lax enough
to ignore it.
