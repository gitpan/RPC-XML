RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.46

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

Applied a patch from Andrew Langmead to fix a bug in the uri() method
of RPC::XML::Client. Prior, retrieving the value could accidentally
reset it. Applied another fix from him to prevent a possible warning.

Applied another patch to better handle testing of the availability of
compression in the client.

Moving around some of the RPM spec-file generation caused problems
with some people trying to build the package if spec.in was missing.
Fixed this in Makefile.PL.

Fix to RPC::XML::Procedure per tip from Stig Porsgaard, to fix the
reading of 'signature' arguments to new() when providing all the
proc data directly. Reported by others as well, but Stig nailed it
down to a specific line.
