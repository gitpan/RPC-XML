RPC::XML - An implementation of XML-RPC

Version: 0.55

WHAT IS IT

The RPC::XML package is an implementation of XML-RPC. The module provides
classes for sample client and server implementations, a server designed as an
Apache location-handler, and a suite of data-manipulation classes that are
used by them.


USING RPC::XML

There are not any pre-packaged executables in this distribution (except for a
utility tool). Client usage will usually be along the lines of:

    use RPC::XML::Client;
    ...
    my $client = new RPC::XML::Client
        'http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php';
    my $req = RPC::XML::request->new('meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring', 'perl');
    my $res = $client->send_request($req);
    # This returns an object of the RPC::XML::response class. This double-call
    # of value() first gets a RPC::XML::* data object from the response, then
    # the actual data from it:
    my $value = $res->value->value;

Running a simple server is not much more involved:

    use RPC::XML::Server;
    ...
    my $srv = new RPC::XML::Server (host => 'localhost',
                                    port => 9000);
    # You would then use $srv->add_method to add some remotely-callable code
    ...
    $srv->accept_loop; # Stays in an accept/connect loop


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If RPC::XML passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.

CHANGES

lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm:
Fix from Thomax G. to the loop-invariance near line 1403, for a bug
that mostly appears with openACS-based clients.
                                                                               
t/60_net_server.t:
Clarify in the message emitted why the tests are skipped when
Net::Server is not available.
                                                                                
lib/RPC/XML/Server.pm:
Fix based on input from several sources: The Content-Encoding header
was not being set correctly for responses when compression was applied
to the response message.
                                                                              
lib/RPC/XML/Procedure.pm:
Applied a fix from the Debian maintainer of this package for their
distribution, David Parrish: auto-reloading of methods was not actually
stuffing the new data into the calling object.

lib/Apache/RPC/Server.pm:
Applied a patch from a user to fix a problem with reading PerlSetVar
values withing a <Location> block (worked fine in <Perl> blocks),
as well as a small addition to the examples in the docs.
